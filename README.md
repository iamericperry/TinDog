This is my practice project to help learn Bootstrap.

4/16/2020
I was able to successfully complete the Bootstrap 4 section of my web development course and I feel great! I feel really confident in myself learning web development and I hope I can keep this feeling as I progress. The site is not completed yet but I look forward to seeing the outcome of site.
